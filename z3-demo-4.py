# This program utilizes the Z3 solver to define two real variables, `x` and `y`, and then solves a set of inequalities. Specifically, it checks for solutions that satisfy the conditions \(x^2 + y^2 > 3\) and \(x^3 + y < 5\). The `solve()` function evaluates these inequalities and attempts to find values for `x` and `y` that meet both conditions simultaneously, demonstrating how Z3 can be used to analyze and solve nonlinear mathematical problems.

from z3 import *

x = Real('x')
y = Real('y')
solve(x**2 + y**2 > 3, x**3 + y < 5)
